            1. <b>Heidegger's Temporality, History, or Story in Being and Time</b>

            <p>In this seminar, I would like to discuss Temporality in Heidegger's Being and Time. Heidegger's
            most famous work, Being and Time, as the title suggests, is an analysis of "being" and "time."
            However, it is important to note that this work does not deal with "being" in general or "time" as
            we conventionally understand it.</p>
            
            <p>Another name for Being and Time is An Analysis of Dasein. In other words, this book is an
            analysis of the being and time of Dasein. Therefore, to understand this analysis, we first need to
            understand what Dasein is.</p>
            
            <p>This lecture begins with a brief explanation of Dasein as a being. As we analyze the structure of
            Dasein's being, we will encounter and address the following concepts that Heidegger presents:
            world, temporality, death, anxiety, care, guilt, freedom, and understanding.</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, I will explain how my interpretation of emergence (Geschehen), history (Geschichte), 
            or story (Geschichte) integrates into these concepts and discuss their significance.</p>
